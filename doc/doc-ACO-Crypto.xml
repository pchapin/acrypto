  <title>Package ACO.Crypto</title>

  <para>The package <package>ACO.Crypto</package> (SPARK Ada) contains all the low level
    cryptographic algorithms in this libary. These algorithms are categorized by various child
    packages as described elsewhere in this document. The package <package>ACO.Crypto</package>
    itself contains a few general purpose helper types that are useful to several different
    child packages.</para>

  <synopsis>
    type Cipher_Mode is (Encrypt_Mode, Decrypt_Mode, Neither_Mode);
  </synopsis>

  <para>The type <type>Cipher_Mode</type> is used by the various cipher objects to track if they
    are encrypting or decrypting their input data. Most cipher objects start in a neutral state
      (<literal>Neither_Mode</literal>) but are then committed to encryption or decyrption after
    they are initialized (or in some cases after they are first used). Once an object has been
    committed to a particular mode, it can not usually be switched to a different mode. See the
    detailed documentation for the child packages of <package>ACO.Crypto</package> for specific
    exceptions to this rule.</para>
