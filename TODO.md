TODO Items
==========

The items in this file are in no particular order. They are grouped by area.


Crypto
------

+ Submit my Blowfish implementation to Schneier for possible inclusion on his Blowfish
  implementation page. That might be a nice way to get Ada's name in front of some more
  programmers.


Math
----

+ Benchmark tests for the Very_Long integer type would be useful. After creating some nice
  benchmarks, steps could be taken to improve the performance (profile, etc?). This type is
  fundamental to the public key algorithms so good efficiency is important.


Benchmarks
----------

+ Consider creating a table on the web site of ACO performance relative to OpenSSL.


Documentation
-------------

+ Improve the build documentation. Also describe how to run the unit tests.

+ Right now package ACO.Math.Very_Longs is documented using a <variablelist>. Should the
  other packages be documented in a similar way? In any event the method used should be
  consistent across all packages.
