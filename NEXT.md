Next Steps
==========

Finish converting all SPARK code to SPARK 2014.
+ Start working on the proofs!

Finish the AES implementation.
+ Write MixColumns and InvMixColumns.
+ Review code. Be sure hard coded constant values are being avoided as much as possible (to make
  supporting other key sizes easier in the future).
+ Discharge verfication conditions to prove free of runtime errors.
+ Write test program to exercise implemenation against Known Answer Tests from the AES Algorithm
  Validation Suite.
